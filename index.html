      <h1 class="ruinh1"> Ruins of St. Paul's Cathedral </h1>
      <p class="ruinp">The Ruins of St. Paul's refer to the facade of what was originally the Church of Mater Dei built in 1602-1640,
         destroyed by fire in 1835, and the ruins of St. Paul's College, which stood adjacent to the Church. As a whole, 
         the old Church of Mater Dei, St. Paul's College and Mount Fortress were all Jesuit constructions and formed what 
         can be perceived as the Macao's "acropolis". Close by, the archaeological remains of the old College of St. Paul 
         stand witness to what was the first western-style university in the Far East, with an elaborate academic programme. 
         Nowadays, the facade of the Ruins of St. Paul's functions symbolically as an altar to the city.</p>

    <div class="Senado">
      <h1 class="Senadoh1">Senado Square</h1>
      <p class="Senadop">Senado Square has been Macao's urban centre for centuries, and is still the most popular venue for public 
        events and celebrations today. Located close to the former Senate building, Sam Kai Vui Kun ( Kuan Tai Temple ) is also a 
        reminder of the active participation of the local Chinese community in general civic affairs, providing a clear example of 
        the multicultural dimension of the Macao community. The square is surrounded by pastel coloured neo-classical buildings, 
        creating a consistent and harmonious Mediterranean atmosphere.
